# Customer-Segmentation
In this project i try to solve unsupervised machine learning problem on  dataset where the company is UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The most customer of this company are wholesalers. The original data set came from UCI Machine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail and there is also available on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data.

## Goals
Set the class and the segment label of each customer and grouping into several segments which aims to how the company will treat customers in the future.

## Features
- InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
- StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
- Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.
- Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
- InvoiceDate: Invice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.
- UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.
- CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
- Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

Since this dataset is a Unsupervised Learning Dataset, therefore i should cluster each customerID to process for further. in this case i labeling each customer id using RFM(Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method and find a way how to treat customer based on their segment depends business action.


## Highlights

So this is the sample of dataset that i use in this project and the descriptive statistics table.

and the descriptive statistics table.

- when i see the statistical table i got confused why there are negative values in Qantity and UnitPrice minimum value. So i assume that was canceled order and i drop them negative values.
- i drop the missing values too
- Since then there is no total amount table, i added the 'spend' column which from UnitPrice*Quantity
In this dataframe the amount of customer from UK is so dominating, so i decide to separate those.


### UK Data
in this section ill find which class is suitable for each customerID based on RFM Score and the way to determine the RFM score is :
- Recency = Latest Transaction Date - Last Invoice Data
- Frequency = count of invoice no. of transaction
- Monetary = Sum of total spend for each customer id
and the the distribution plot of RFM value is like this.

The RFM value is set now, so i change them into 5 rank score using quantile method. the lowest the score the better.
after i get all of that, i sum up the rank value RFM to labeled which class is suit for each customer (Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze).

Last but not least, giving the label eachs customerid based on aggregated each RFM scores (115 ,555 ,111 , etc).

- Champions 1-2, 1-2, 1-2
- Canâ€™t Lose Them 4-5, 1-2, 1-2
- Hibernating 4-5, 3-5, 1-5
- Lost 5, 3-5, 3-5
- etc

#### note: class and segment labeling depends on company business action.


## Conclusion
RFM method is so useful for solving Customer Segmentation problem because it depends on customer activity(Recency), customer transaction frequency(Frequency), and how big their spend their money(Monetary).
from the segmentation result, we can treat the customer different way depend on the result. for example :
- Best Customer : We can give them reward. They can become the early buyers when we have new products and also can promote the products too.
- Loyal Customer : We can give them membership/loyalty program or recommended related product to upsell them and help to become best customers.
- New Customer : Start building relationship to this customers and give them special offers to increase their activity
- Cant Lose Them : bring them back and offer relevant promo. give them survey is great too.
Again, it all depends on the Company business action.
